# Fair Christmas Multiverse Movie Review Rubric 🎄

One rubric.
Many timelines.
Infinite Hallmark violations.

This repository contains the canonical scoring system used to review,
roast, and lovingly catalog Christmas movies across the **Fair Christmas Multiverse™**.

## What lives here
- `rubric/Fair Christmas Movie Review Rubric {version}.md`  
  → The current canonical rubric (always up to date)

- `rubric/versions/`  
  → Frozen historical versions (e.g. v5.1)

- `printable templates/`  
  → Blank scorecards and completed-review templates

- `reviews/{Year}`  
  → One markdown file per movie, per year

## Philosophy
This project does not punish movies for being bad.
It punishes them for being boring about it.

Chaos is a feature.
Rewatchability is sacred.
